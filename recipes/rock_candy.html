        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Rock candy is easy to make at home, it tastes great, and it's a fun
            recipe to do with kids. Better yet, it doubles as a science
            experiment because you get to watch the sugar crystals grow. It's
            also an excellent opportunity to get creative in the kitchen
            because the color and flavoring combinations you can create are
            endless.
